7/15/21: Started project. Created folder and file layout structure. Created database and table.


7/16/21: Added bootstrap grid to center content on all pages. 

Updated view weights page to have select all query and var_dump dates and weights that were manually added to DB.
Will need to create table to display this info and add edit and delete buttons if incorrect info is submitted.

Trying out date and time pickers for add weights page form.


7/17/21: Added table to view weights page that uses each date and weight as a row. Added edit and delete
buttons that will have functionality added later.

Added app to apache vhost configuration to use bwt.site to access site.
Site can no longer accesses jquery and bootstrap files in node_modules folder. Getting not found errors.


7/18/21: Added gulp and set it up to move jquery and bootstrap files in /node_modules folder to /public/js/dist folder.
May move them into specific folders in dist later.


7/19/21: Changed folder structure. All views are currently in /public folder.


7/20/21: Added jquery-datetimepicker for a date/time picker on the add weight page.


7/21/21: Made updates data from form on add weights page to be posted to insertWeight.php. 
Weight and datetime stamp are then inserted into weights table. After inserting weight the page
is redirected the view weights page.

Updated add weight form to use bootstrap styling. Started with horizontal form, but updated column size of 
the label which moved input fields below label like regular bootstrap form. This probably looks better 
because it uses more space on this page that has little content.


7/22/21: Added delete modal to view weights page when clicking delete button. Modal opens using
the option without javascript by prefixing '#' to value of data-bs-target attribute. 
Trying to open it with javascript or jquery to pass record id that will be sent to delete record.
Currenty getting "Cannot read property 'classList' of undefined" error when clicking delete button.


7/23/21: Continuing to work on delete weight record. Clicking delete now gets the id, date, and weight from
data- attributes in the <tr> of the selected weight record and passes it to the modal. Now need to pass the
id to backend to delete the weight. 


7/24/21: Centered header title and buttons.


7/25/21: Finished delete weight record from view weights page. 
Currently reloading page after clicking OK on success deleted modal to remove the deleted weight record from
the table. May change this page to get data from ajax request and make ajax request after deletion or
edit of weight record.


7/26/21: Added form validation to add weight form using jquery. 
Submit button is not enabled until the date input is a valid date and the weight input is a number.
Needed to use input event on weight input to get the entered value. Not sure why change event did not work.
Needed to use both input and change events to work with date input. Date picker needed change event
and needed to use input event if date string is manually edited in the date field.


7/27/21: Updated insertWeight.php to check data before attempting to insert data.
Currently prints error if there is an issue with data or sql error. Need to display error if mistake
happens. Currently PHP is used to post form data. May change this to use jquery ajax to handle
request and responses.


7/29/21: Added ability to edit weight record. 
Need to update edit success modal to show old info and updated info. 
Need to add input validation before being able to submit on the edit weight record modal.


7/30/21: Updated edit success modal to show what the old date and weight have been updated to.
Added input validation to edit modal input fields before submit button is enabled.

Updated header to use blue gradient and removed underline from link.


7/31/21: Added border around site container.
Changed background-color of body to gray (#eee) and kept bootstrap container background-color white.
Changed color of header buttons from green to blue (bootstrap primary).


8/2/21: Updated jquery-datetimepicker to disable selecting future dates.

Added header title to pages and update button of current page to be underlined.

Made updates to display message instead of table if there are no weight records.


8/6/21: Made updates for view weights page to use AJAX to update weights table by removing a deleted
table row or updating the table data in an updated row. Removed refreshing the page after these actions. 

Needed to move the functions when clicking confirm buttons that make XHR's for delete and edit out of 
being inner functions to table buttons because clicking a button would bind it and then clicking 
multiple different table row buttons to delete or edit would make multiple XHR's for the confirm 
delete or edit row buttons thats were already clicked.

Currently after editing a row, the table row data will be updated, but clicking the edit button again
will show the original data. Need to udpate the data attributes for the row.
