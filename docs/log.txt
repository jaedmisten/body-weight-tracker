7/15/21: Started project. Created folder and file layout structure. Created database and table.


7/16/21: Added bootstrap grid to center content on all pages. 

Updated view weights page to have select all query and var_dump dates and weights that were manually added to DB.
Will need to create table to display this info and add edit and delete buttons if incorrect info is submitted.

Trying out date and time pickers for add weights page form.


7/17/21: Added table to view weights page that uses each date and weight as a row. Added edit and delete
buttons that will have functionality added later.

Added app to apache vhost configuration to use bwt.site to access site.
Site can no longer accesses jquery and bootstrap files in node_modules folder. Getting not found errors.


7/18/21: Added gulp and set it up to move jquery and bootstrap files in /node_modules folder to /public/js/dist folder.
May move them into specific folders in dist later.


7/19/21: Changed folder structure. All views are currently in /public folder.


7/20/21: Added jquery-datetimepicker for a date/time picker on the add weight page.


7/21/21: Made updates data from form on add weights page to be posted to insertWeight.php. 
Weight and datetime stamp are then inserted into weights table. After inserting weight the page
is redirected the view weights page.

Updated add weight form to use bootstrap styling. Started with horizontal form, but updated column size of 
the label which moved input fields below label like regular bootstrap form. This probably looks better 
because it uses more space on this page that has little content.


7/22/21: Added delete modal to view weights page when clicking delete button. Modal opens using
the option without javascript by prefixing '#' to value of data-bs-target attribute. 
Trying to open it with javascript or jquery to pass record id that will be sent to delete record.
Currenty getting "Cannot read property 'classList' of undefined" error when clicking delete button.


7/23/21: Continuing to work on delete weight record. Clicking delete now gets the id, date, and weight from
data- attributes in the <tr> of the selected weight record and passes it to the modal. Now need to pass the
id to backend to delete the weight. 


7/24/21: Centered header title and buttons.


7/25/21: Finished delete weight record from view weights page. 
Currently reloading page after clicking OK on success deleted modal to remove the deleted weight record from
the table. May change this page to get data from ajax request and make ajax request after deletion or
edit of weight record.


7/26/21: Added form validation to add weight form using jquery. 
Submit button is not enabled until the date input is a valid date and the weight input is a number.
Needed to use input event on weight input to get the entered value. Not sure why change event did not work.
Needed to use both input and change events to work with date input. Date picker needed change event
and needed to use input event if date string is manually edited in the date field.


7/27/21: Updated insertWeight.php to check data before attempting to insert data.
Currently prints error if there is an issue with data or sql error. Need to display error if mistake
happens. Currently PHP is used to post form data. May change this to use jquery ajax to handle
request and responses.


7/29/21: Added ability to edit weight record. 
Need to update edit success modal to show old info and updated info. 
Need to add input validation before being able to submit on the edit weight record modal.


7/30/21: Updated edit success modal to show what the old date and weight have been updated to.
Added input validation to edit modal input fields before submit button is enabled.

Updated header to use blue gradient and removed underline from link.


7/31/21: Added border around site container.
Changed background-color of body to gray (#eee) and kept bootstrap container background-color white.
Changed color of header buttons from green to blue (bootstrap primary).


8/2/21: Updated jquery-datetimepicker to disable selecting future dates.

Added header title to pages and update button of current page to be underlined.

Made updates to display message instead of table if there are no weight records.


8/5/21: Updated style of view weights table to use bootstrap table style for smaller table and
striped rows. Changed table header background color to match blue header buttons. I may change
the background color to match the linear gradient to the site header.


8/6/21: Made updates for view weights page to use AJAX to update weights table by removing a deleted
table row or updating the table data in an updated row. Removed refreshing the page after these actions. 

Needed to move the functions when clicking confirm buttons that make XHR's for delete and edit out of 
being inner functions to table buttons because clicking a button would bind it and then clicking 
multiple different table row buttons to delete or edit would make multiple XHR's for the confirm 
delete or edit row buttons thats were already clicked.

Currently after editing a row, the table row data will be updated, but clicking the edit button again
will show the original data. Need to udpate the data attributes for the row.


8/7/21: Made updates to fix the edit dialog to show correct values after the weight record has already 
been updated. Added id to edit button that concatenates the currect weight record id to the end of the 
button and then used jquery to select that button and update the data attributes for the element.

After editing a date the updated row changes date format from '2021-01-01 00:00:00' to '2021/01/01 00:00'.
It would probably be better to change the time from '00:00:000' to '00:00' because seconds do not
matter for this time stamp.


8/8/21: Moved js scripts for view weights page and add weight record page into separate js files in js folder.

Changed the date format on the site to be '01/01/2021 00:00' instead of '2021-01-01 00:00:00'. This 
change was made on date time picker, forms, view weights table, and modals.

On view weights page, updated jquery selectors for clicking edit and delete buttons to use wildcards on 
the id's instead of the class of the button. The wildcard selectors were $('[id^=delete-button-]') and 
$('[id^=edit-button-]').

Fixed bug where after editing a row if you clicked delete the old info would be listed in the confirmation
modal. Needed to update the data attributes of the delete button of the edited row.


8/9/21: Updated background of header buttons, table header, and modal headers to use the same gradient
as the header.


8/10/21: Moved all view files from /public to /public/views. Updated all the needed links to script files
and php files.


8/11/21: Added fitness motivational videos to home page.


8/13/21: Added error modals if error response is returned from deleting or updating a weight record.
Removed console.log messages from viewWeights.js.


8/15/21: Created custom pages for HTTP error codes for 404 missing pages and 500 server errors.

After moving php view files to /public/views going straight to the root of the site gave 404 errors
when clicking links. Updated the links to use absolute urls to the views folder. 
Should try to use pretty urls at some point to not show the url slugs like /views/addWeightForm.php.


8/19/21: Changed add weight form to use jquery ajax to post data instead of php posting form. Will
make it easier to display errors for inserting weight records.

Added error message to add weights form if unable to insert weight record.


8/22/21: Updated CRUD operations so that if an exception is thrown a 500 error is returned instead of
displaying the exception message.


8/24/21: Made date and weights columns sortable for the view weights table. Made the column link headers a 
link to the view weights page with query parameters for the column to order by and the order (ASC or DESC).
Used $_GET to assign the query parameters to variables for the sql query.
Caret up or down icon is displayed next to the sorted column. Currently table column size gets wider when 
icon is displayed. Need to fix so that table column size remains the same regardless of icon being displayed
or not.


8/26/21: Added Google line chart to view weights page. Needed to assign the php $weights variable to a javascript
variable by using: let weightObjects = <?php echo json_encode($weights); ?>;
Then updated this array of objects to be an array of arrays without the id and using the first element as the 
headers of the chart.
    let weightObjects = <?php echo json_encode($weights); ?>;
    let weights = [['Date', 'Weight']]; 
    for (let i = 0; i < weightObjects.length; i++) {
        weights[i + 1] = [ new Date(weightObjects[i].date), parseFloat(weightObjects[i].weight) ];
    }


8/27/21: Made updates to only show chart if there are at least five weight records.


8/28/21: Fixed centering of chart being to the right. Put content on view weights page in separate bootstrap 
rows and columns.


8/30/21: Put content on add weights page in separate bootstrap rows and columns. Centered form by changing offsets.


9/2/21: Added option to hide or show chart on view weights page.


9/7/21: Added database schema file 'body_weight_tracker.sql' to the project and created readme.md file.


9/18/21: Removed duplicate code for creating javascript array of weight records for google chart.

Fixed bug where sorting table by weight changed chart from horizontal line to vertical line. Javascript array
for chart always needs to be sorted by date for line chart layout to be correct. Made updates so that if PHP
was sorting table by weights the javascript array would be sorted by date.


9/21/21: Moved datetimepicker plugin that was used for add weight form from footer of project to the add weights page.


9/23/21: Added to and from date pickers to weights chart to narrow results. Set the first selectable from date to 
oldest date in weight records and last selectable to date to current day. Will Need to submit date ranges and 
refresh chart.


10/2/21: Added margin of 15px to main bootstrap container that is used on all pages.


10/5/21: Moved functionality for configuring chart data to be outside of loading chart and drawing chart code blocks.
This functionality to prepare data for chart is now in prepareChartData() function. This way prepareChartData() can
be called and then loadChart() can be called with the prepared data.
Created event listener for clicking button to narrow to and from dates of chart.


10/10/21: Added code for charts to and from date pickers to narrow down date range on chart. 
Need to update style of date selectors. They are currenlty too wide and should probably fit on one line.
Need to add error response if there is issue with dates selected.


10/11/21: The date time picker was not working when editing a weight record because I removed the date time picker
plugin from the footer of the app and just moved it to the add weight record page. Added the date time picker
plugin to the view weights page to fix this.

Updated line chart date filter form to be on one line. Need to make updates to have the spacing of from
and to words and the space to the date pickers to be consistent.


10/28/21: Changed size of filter chart date pickers input boxes from bootstraps col-sm-2 to col-sm-3.
On add weights page, put a line break between "Date and Time" and the format it needs to be in to keep the line from
expanding past the text box.


11/13/21: Added error logging to View Weight page if error occurs when retrieving all data. An error message is 
logged along with the exception message, and the call stack.
Var_dumping the exception to the page has been removed.

Added error logging to the rest of the php files that have CRUD sql statements.


11/15/21: Deleted unused getWeights.php file.


11/25/21: Added a statistics page. Currently has body weight average and standard deviation.


11/26/21: Fixed error with standard deviations. I was not subtracting the average from the current weight
in the loop before squaring it.
Added lowest weight and highest weight to the stats page.
Changed layout of stats to use a table.

Changed page buttons header of site to be correctly centered.


11/27/21: Updated statistics page to only show stats if there is at least three weight records and to  show 
a message if there is less than three weight records. 


11/28/21: Fixed issue on stats page with getting incorrect mode and only have mode if the weight appears
more than once.


12/16/21: Added &nbsp; html entities in front of the To picker on the chart filter to even up the spacing
to make it match the from picker.

Made update to prevent a new added weight from being 0 or a negative number.
