Updated view weights page to have select all query and var_dump dates and weights that were manually added to DB.
Will need to create table to display this info and add edit and delete buttons if incorrect info is submitted.

Trying out date and time pickers for add weights page form.

buttons that will have functionality added later.

Site can no longer accesses jquery and bootstrap files in node_modules folder. Getting not found errors.
